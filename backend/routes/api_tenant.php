/**
 * Tenant-scope API routes (API_CONTRACT §9.1, ARCHITECTURE §5.1).
 *
 * These routes are loaded by bootstrap/app.php as the primary `api:` route file.
 * Every route here:
 *   - Is prefixed with /api automatically by Laravel's api route loader.
 *   - Inherits the `api` middleware group (throttle, json parsing, etc.).
 *   - Additionally runs: CorrelationId (prepended to the api group in
 *     bootstrap/app.php) → auth:api → tenant.resolve → tenant.active.
 *
 * Full middleware pipeline for these routes (ARCHITECTURE §5.1):
 *   EnsureHttps → CorrelationId → Authenticate(auth:api) → ResolveTenant
 *   → EnsureTenantActive → [Authorize] → [RateLimit] → [Idempotency] → Handler
 *
 * Endpoints are registered here as modules are built. At this stage the file
 * exists and is valid PHP — no endpoints are defined until Wave 5+ modules ship.
