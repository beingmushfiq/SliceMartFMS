/**
 * Enforces tenant lifecycle status before any business logic runs
 * (ARCHITECTURE §3.2, §5.1, API_CONTRACT §3.1).
 *
 * Status rules (from the `tenants.status` column, DATABASE_DESIGN §2):
 *
 *   active    → pass through unrestricted.
 *   trial     → pass through unrestricted (trial is an active state).
 *   past_due  → pass through as READ-ONLY. TenantContext::isReadOnly() returns
 *               true. Actions that perform writes check this flag and throw
 *               a domain exception before touching the database. This gives the
 *               tenant access to read their data while billing is resolved.
 *   suspended → throw TenantSuspended → 402 TENANT_INACTIVE.
 *   cancelled → throw TenantSuspended → 402 TENANT_INACTIVE.
 *
 * This middleware MUST run after ResolveTenant (which builds TenantContext).
 * Running it before ResolveTenant would throw a RuntimeException from
 * TenantContext::current().
